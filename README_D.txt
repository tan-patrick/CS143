I worked alone on this project, so no work needed to be divided.

I was unable to get the larger test examples working. The first small an dmedium ones appear to be working correctly however. There were no major changes from the specifications and no helper functions were made for this part of the project.

I went back and fixed all of the error codes for previous parts, as I had been using just 0 and 1 instead of the error codes in Bruinbase.h.

Note: I would like to use my last two grace days for this project.
