I worked alone on this project, so no work needed to be divided.

I followed the specs and the predefined function definitions. The only change I made was creating a new function to recursively insert the key and rid. This was called in the insert function to traverse down the tree to the correct leaf node, and traverse backwards until there is a node that is not full (or reaches the root node).

Aside from this, I output 0s for successful functions and 1s when errors occurred. I also created a display function to display the tree, using the display functions I had for the leaf and non leaf node classes. I deleted the display function before turning in the project.
