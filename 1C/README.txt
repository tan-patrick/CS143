I worked alone on this project, so no work needed to be divided and nothing that I could directly improve in a team setting for better collaboration.

I met all of the project criteria, creating pages for adding actors or directors, movie information, comments to movies, actors to movies, and directors to movies. I also have two browsing pages for actors and movies, which have the appropriate information shown. Finally, I have a search page which can be accessed at the index, either of the browsing pages, or the search page itself.

For the each of the input pages, I checked whether the user input the information in the correct formats and that all necessary inputs were filled.

On the home page, I do not have direct links to the browsing pages for actor or movie. These can be accessed through the search function. Additionally, there is no direct link to the search page. It can be accessed through the search box on the home page, or either of the browsing pages.

Small additional features were added to the project. I added a return to home page from each page to allow easy movement throughout the website. I also attempted to add instructions and success notifications when the user attempts to input new information to the database.
