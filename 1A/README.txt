I worked alone on this project, so no work needed to be divided. I started with the base example calculator, using the HTML from the example for the website. Then, I added the php function that implemented the calculator, making sure to follow the rules in the specifications. Finally, I checked the test cases and fixed issues with 0/0 (dividing by zero) and subtracting a negative, preventing error functions to display and displaying invalid expression.
