I worked alone on this project, so no work needed to be divided.

I created two different classes for leaf nodes and non leaf nodes. I added a constructor, a struct that held one pair (key, rid and key, pid), and an int variable that held the maximum number of keys the buffer could hold.

Aside from this, I output 0s for successful functions and 1s when errors occurred. I created a display function in order to ensure that the functions were working as intended. I deleted the display function before turning in the project.
